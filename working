The attendance system is designed to recognize faces in real time using a webcam, match them with stored face data, and log attendance in an Excel sheet. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how the system works:

1. Initialization
The system initializes the webcam (cv2.VideoCapture(0)) to capture video frames.
It checks whether the camera is properly connected. If not, an error is displayed.
2. Loading Known Faces
The program reads images from a predefined folder (D:\known_faces).
Each image filename follows the format:
"Name[RRN].jpg"
Example: John Doe[123456].jpg
Using face_recognition.face_encodings(), it extracts the unique facial features (encodings) from each image.
The extracted data is stored in three lists:
known_face_encodings → Stores facial encodings
known_face_names → Stores names of individuals
known_face_rrns → Stores corresponding Roll Registration Numbers (RRN)
3. Real-time Face Recognition
The system continuously captures live video frames from the webcam.
Each frame is converted into an RGB format (required for face recognition).
The system detects all faces in the frame using face_recognition.face_locations().
It extracts the face encodings of detected faces using face_recognition.face_encodings().
4. Matching Faces with Known Data
For each detected face, it compares the encoding with stored encodings using face_recognition.compare_faces().
If a match is found:
The system retrieves the person's name and RRN.
If attendance is not already marked for the day, it proceeds to mark it in the Excel sheet.
If no match is found, the face is labeled as "Unknown".
5. Marking Attendance in Excel
The program checks if today’s date column exists in the Excel sheet:

If not, a new column is created for the date.
It searches for the student's name and RRN in the sheet:

If found, attendance is marked as "✔".
If not, a new row is added with the student's details and attendance.
The Excel file is then saved to ensure data is not lost.

6. Displaying Results on Screen
A rectangle is drawn around detected faces using cv2.rectangle().
The recognized person's name is displayed using cv2.putText().
The live camera feed is shown in a window (cv2.imshow()).
7. Opening the Excel File Automatically
Once attendance is logged, the system automatically opens the Excel file in a new window using subprocess.Popen().
This ensures the user can view the updated attendance sheet.
8. Exit Conditions
The system stops running when:
Attendance is successfully logged.
The user manually presses ‘q’ on the keyboard.
