Key Features:

Face Recognition:

Uses the face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces.
Loads known face encodings from a specified directory (D:\known_faces).
Matches detected faces with stored face data.
Attendance Management (Excel Integration):

Maintains an attendance log in an Excel file (Attendance.xlsx).
If a recognized face is detected, it marks attendance for that individual.
Automatically adds new entries for unregistered students.
Ensures duplicate attendance entries for the same day are not recorded.
Camera Integration:

Captures live video feed using OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture).
Detects faces in real time and processes them for recognition.
Threaded Excel Access:

Opens the attendance Excel file in a separate thread using subprocess.Popen.
Ensures smooth execution without delaying face recognition.
Graphical Feedback:

Displays live camera feed with detected faces.
Marks recognized faces with a green rectangle and displays their names.
If an unknown face is detected, it is labeled "Unknown".
User Interaction:

Allows manual termination by pressing ‘q’ on the keyboard.
Proper cleanup of camera resources and windows when the program ends.

 # Required Dependencies:
opencv-python (for video capture and display)
